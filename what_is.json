        "desc1":"  A chemical element is a chemical substance that cannot be broken down into other substances.",
        "desc2":" The basic particle that constitutes a chemical element is the atom, and each chemical element is distinguished by the number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as its atomic number.",
        "desc3":"  The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that discovered native minerals like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold (though the concept of a chemical element was not yet understood). ",
        "desc4":"  There are now 118 known elements. In this context, known means observed well enough, even from just a few decay products, to have been differentiated from other elements",
        "desc5":" The remaining 24 heavier elements, not found today either on Earth or in astronomical spectra, have been produced artificially: these are all radioactive, with very short half-lives; if any atoms of these elements were present at the formation of Earth, they are extremely likely, to the point of certainty, to have already decayed, and if present in novae have been in quantities too small to have been noted"

        "name" :"Periodic Table",
        "desc1":"  The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of the elements, arranges the chemical elements into rows (periods) and columns (groups). ",
        "desc2":"  It is an organizing icon of chemistry and is widely used in physics and other sciences.",
        "desc3":"  It is a depiction of the periodic law, which says that when the elements are arranged in order of their atomic numbers an approximate recurrence of their properties is evident. ",
        "desc4":"  The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on atomic mass. ",
        "desc5":"  Vertical, horizontal and diagonal trends characterize the periodic table. Metallic character increases going down a group and decreases from left to right across a period. Nonmetallic character increases going from the bottom left of the periodic table to the top right."
    },
    {
        "name" :"Group",
        "desc1":"  In chemistry, a group (also known as a family) is a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements.",
        "desc2":"  There are 18 numbered groups in the periodic table; the 14 f-block columns, between groups 2 and 3, are not numbered.",
        "desc3":"  The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their atoms (i.e., the same core charge), because most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron.",
        "desc4":"  There are three systems of group numbering for the groups; the same number may be assigned to different groups depending on the system being used.",
        "desc5":" The modern numbering system of group 1 to group 18 has been recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) since 1988."
    },
    {
        "name" :"Period",
        "desc1":"  A period on the periodic table is a row of chemical elements. All elements in a row have the same number of electron shells.",
        "desc2":"  Each next element in a period has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. ",
        "desc3":"  Arranged this way, elements in the same group (column) have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. For example, the halogens lie in the second-to-last group (group 17) and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to gain one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration.",
        "desc4":"  Modern quantum mechanics explains these periodic trends in properties in terms of electron shells. ",
        "desc5":" There are currently seven complete periods in the periodic table, comprising the 118 known elements. Any new elements will be placed into an eighth period; see extended periodic table. The elements are colour-coded below by their block: red for the s-block, yellow for the p-block, blue for the d-block, and green for the f-block."
    },
    {
        "name" :"Block",
        "desc1":" A block of the periodic table is a set of elements unified by the atomic orbitals their valence electrons or vacancies lie in.",
        "desc2":" The term appears to have been first used by Charles Janet.[2] Each block is named after its characteristic orbital: s-block, p-block, d-block, f-block and g-block.",
        "desc3":" The block names (s, p, d, and f) are derived from the spectroscopic notation for the value of an electrons azimuthal quantum number: sharp (0), principal (1), diffuse (2), or fundamental (3). Succeeding notations proceed in alphabetical order, as g, h, etc., though elements that would belong in such blocks have not yet been found.",
        "desc4":" The division into blocks is justified by their distinctive nature: s is characterized, except in H and He, by highly electropositive metals; p by a range of very distinctive metals and non-metals, many of them essential to life; d by metals with multiple oxidation states; f by metals so similar that their separation is problematic.",
        "desc5":" Useful statements about the elements can be made on the basis of the block they belong to and their position in it, for example highest oxidation state, density, melting point"
